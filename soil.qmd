Summer temperatures are on the rise, so what does this mean for soil health? Does warmer weather deplete soil moisture levels? Let's see what the trend suggests ⬇️

```{r}
library(reticulate)

use_condaenv("base", required = TRUE)
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true 
#| file: code/soil-heat.py
#| fig-cap: The scatter plot explores the relationship between maximum summer temperatures and average soil moisture. The trend line shows a slight negative correlation, suggesting that higher temperatures are associated with lower soil moisture levels.
```

# Moisture Matters
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true 
#| file: code/soil-moist.py
#| fig-cap: The chart here displays soil moisture during summer from the 1980s to the 2020s. The red dashed trend line indicates an overall stable trend with minor fluctuations over the years, though it remains quite low.
```

# Tracking Summer Soil Dryness
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true 
#| file: code/soil-dry.py
#| fig-cap: This area chart outlines the number of dry soil days during summer over the years. The blue dashed trend line shows an increasing trend, indicating that the region is experiencing more dry soil days over time.
```

# Next up:
Since rising temperatures and hotter days cause drier soils, does this mean evaporation speeds up in the summer? This in turn could potentially affect the area's rainfall!
