Summer temperatures are on the rise, so what does this mean for soil health? Does warmer weather dry up soil moisture levels? Let's see what the trend suggests.

```{r}

use_condaenv("base", required = TRUE)
```

# Hotter Summers, Drier Soils?
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true 
#| file: code/soil-heat.py
#| fig-cap: The scatter plot explores the relationship between maximum summer temperatures and average soil moisture. The trend line shows a slight negative correlation, suggesting that higher temperatures are associated with lower soil moisture levels.
```

# Moisture Matters
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true 
#| file: code/soil-moist.py
#| fig-cap: The chart here displays the percentage of soil moisture during summer from 1980 to 2022. The red dashed trend line indicates an overall stable trend, with minor fluctuations over the years.
```

# Tracking Summer Soil Dryness
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true 
#| file: code/soil-dry.py
#| fig-cap: This area chart outlines the number of dry soil days during summer over the years. The blue dashed trend line shows an increasing trend, indicating that the region is experiencing more dry soil days over time.
```

# Next up:
Since rising temperatures and hotter days cause drier soils, does this mean evaporation is also affected speeds up in the Summers? This in turn could potentially affect the rainfall the area.
